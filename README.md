# "Build a paginated Pokemons list with a 'Load more' button" challenge by reactpractice.dev 

Made by **roznerx** (ignaciorosner@gmail.com)

- Fifteenth day of the challenge, now doing something we all love: a Pokédex!
- This was very fun and exciting with all the Pokémons, and using the [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) was really nice!
- The solution was overall quite straightforward, so I decided to throw a little extra and make an UI for the project, taking some styles from the [offical Pokédex site](https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokedex)
- While finishing it, I realized I should revisit all these challenges and create a branch in order to migrate the solution to **TypeScript**, which is what I use on a daily basis

**NOTE:** man, I'm getting really old! Just how many Pokémon exist right now? I stopped playing the games back with **Emerald* and now they have like 1302?!
